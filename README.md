## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Alena

I'm a frontend developer whoâ€™s all about bringing ideas to life through clean code and thoughtful design. With over 7 years in the tech world â€” 5 of those focused on frontend development and 2 in testing â€” I specialize in crafting high-quality websites that are both beautiful and user-friendly.

Right now, Iâ€™m diving deeper into the world of 3D graphics with Three.js and WebGL. Outside of work, Iâ€™m often exploring art, ceramics, and photography â€” anything that feeds my creative side.

- ðŸ”­ Currently exploring Three.js and WebGL  
- ðŸŒ± Learning more about art, ceramics, and photography  
- ðŸ’¬ Always up for chats about frontend, art, or UI/UX design  

Letâ€™s build something beautiful.
