## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Alena

I'm a frontend developer passionate about bringing ideas to life through clean code and thoughtful design. With over 7 years in tech â€” 5 dedicated to frontend development and 2 in testing â€” I specialize in building high-quality websites and mobile apps that are both visually appealing and user-friendly.

Right now, Iâ€™m diving deeper into the world of 3D graphics with Three.js and WebGL. Outside of work, Iâ€™m often exploring art, ceramics, and photography â€” anything that feeds my creative side.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ðŸ”­ Currently exploring Three.js and WebGL <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ðŸŒ± Learning more about art, ceramics, and photography <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ðŸ’¬ Always up for chats about frontend, art, or UI/UX design <br />

Letâ€™s build something beautiful.
